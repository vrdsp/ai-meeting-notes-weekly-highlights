# Lovable Web Interface – Meeting Input Form

## Purpose
This web interface is built using Lovable and is used to capture:
- Completed tasks and key updates (for Weekly Highlights)
- Meeting notes and discussion points (for MoMs)

## Input Fields
- Update Type (Weekly Highlight / MoM)
- Title or Topic
- Description (bullet points)
- Date
- Stakeholders / Recipients (optional)

## Behaviour
- On form submission, the data is sent to an n8n webhook
- No data is processed on the frontend
- The frontend acts only as a structured input layer

## Notes
Screenshots and UI details are intentionally excluded.
The focus of this project is backend automation and workflow design.
